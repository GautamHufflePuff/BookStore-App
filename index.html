		  <p>The first novel in the Harry Potter series and Rowling's debut novel, it follows Harry Potter, a young wizard who discovers his magical heritage on his eleventh birthday, when he receives a letter of acceptance to Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry. This book has never failed to "wow!" me again and again no matter how many times I flip htrough the pages over and over. This is "the" book that started the wizarding world, and so, it is my very favorite, and a precious belonging. I had read this book about 3 years back, from my mother's copy which she bought when she was in 7th grade, and I read it so much the  dusty pages of the novel looked brand new! Anyway, I highly recommend you read this book if you haven't already, trust me, it will bring a smile to your face!</p>
